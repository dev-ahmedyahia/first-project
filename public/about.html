<h2>About Me</h2>


<p>I am Ahmed. I am from a small village in West Sudan.
  I lived almost my entire life there. Only after I was accepted in university did I travel to Khartoum.
  My life has never been easy. Since an early age I have begun working
  and supporting my family, even in university holidays I had to returen 
  to my home village and work. </p>

 <p> Despite all that, I am still ambitious and working towards big dreams. My
  recent graduation from Sudan
  University of Sceince and Technology with first class honour in Electronics 
  Engineering is just the beginning.
