<h2>The Languages I Have Learnt:</h2>

<ul>
    <li> <h3>English Language:</h3> </li>

        <p> I have begun learning English since a very
            young age. Of course I studied English at
            school, but my interset to become a perfect
            Engish speaker has helped to reach my 
            current level of english not only school.
        </p>


    <li><h3>Chinese Languages:</h3></li>
        <p> The number of people who actually
            think Chinese Language is difficult to 
            learn is unbelivable. In fact, people
            claim that it is difficult because 
            of its characters called (han zi). Although 
            this might  seem reasonable, it is 
            not that difficult, once you begin to 
            write, you will certainly enjoy and love the language.

<h2> The Languages I Would Love to Learn:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Spanish Language:</h3></li>
            <p> The Spanish Language is among the most spoken
               languages in the world. I would love to learn Spanish 
               not only because of that but it also seems 
               easy to learn and interesting. 
            </p>

        <li><h3>Japanese Language:</h3></li>
            <P> I would love to learn Japanese because I feel
                japan has interesting culture and I am also thinking
                to pay it a visit in the future.
            </P>
