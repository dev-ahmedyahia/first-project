        <h2> Languages</h2>

            <p> Some people learn languages because this will serve a purpose for them,
                for example they may want to study or work abroad or  simply to get promotion
                on their current postions. However, this is not the case with all people.
                Some learn langauges because they love languages so much, like myself.
                If you want to find out what languages I have learnt so far and what languages 
                I would love to learn, click on the link below.

        <h2>Animals</h2>
             <p>
                When it comes to animals the world is divided into two, Animals Lovers and Animals Haters.
                You will always find Animals Lovers have pets that they adore.
                I  love animals and down below is a list of pets I have.
